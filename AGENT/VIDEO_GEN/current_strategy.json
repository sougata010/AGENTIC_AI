The ambient lighting is provided by soft-box diffusion from an unseen source, gently illuminating the minimalist living space. As the camera glides closer, a hand, highlighted by a subtle rim lighting, enters the frame, holding a minimalist remote control. The focus tightens on the remote and the TV screen as the hand expertly navigates the menus, the screen's practical lighting casting a soft glow on the fingers, culminating in the activation of a hidden 'developer mode' menu.",

  "audio_prompt": "A low, almost imperceptible hum of the smart TV permeates the quiet room. Subtle, crisp clicks of the remote control buttons are heard as the hand navigates the interface. As the 'developer mode' is activated, a soft, ascending electronic chime plays, followed by a gentle, synthetic 'whoosh' sound effect as the ad banners and bloatware icons subtly fade and disappear from the screen, leaving a clean, streamlined interface. A very low-volume, ambient electronic score with a hint of mystery underpins the scene.",
