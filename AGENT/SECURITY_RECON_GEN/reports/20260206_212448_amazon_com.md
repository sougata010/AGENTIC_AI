# Security Report: amazon.com

**Risk:** CRITICAL

## Summary
The target domain, amazon.com, exhibits critical deficiencies in its web security headers, notably lacking Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Referrer-Policy. These omissions significantly increase the risk of client-side attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing. While Strict-Transport-Security is correctly implemented, the cumulative absence of other fundamental security headers presents a substantial security posture weakness.

## Findings
- Absence of Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header, leaving the application vulnerable to various client-side injection attacks.
- Absence of X-Frame-Options header, enabling potential clickjacking attacks.
- Absence of X-Content-Type-Options header, allowing browsers to MIME-sniff content and potentially execute malicious scripts.
- Absence of X-XSS-Protection header, reducing browser-level protection against reflected XSS attacks.
- Absence of Referrer-Policy header, which could lead to unintended leakage of sensitive information in referrer headers.
- Extensive use of third-party services, as evidenced by numerous DNS TXT records, which expands the overall attack surface and introduces potential supply chain risks.

## Attack Surface
- Web application (client-side vulnerabilities)
- DNS infrastructure (potential for misconfigured TXT records, though SPF is robust)
- Third-party service integrations (supply chain risk from external dependencies)
- Email infrastructure (MX and SPF records)

## Recommendations
- Implement a robust Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header to mitigate client-side injection vulnerabilities by restricting content sources.
- Implement the X-Frame-Options header with an appropriate directive (e.g., 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN') to prevent clickjacking attacks.
- Implement the X-Content-Type-Options header with the 'nosniff' directive to prevent MIME-sniffing and enforce proper content type handling.
- Implement the X-XSS-Protection header with '1; mode=block' for enhanced XSS protection in older browsers.
- Implement a suitable Referrer-Policy header (e.g., 'no-referrer-when-downgrade' or 'same-origin') to control the information sent in the Referer header.
- Conduct regular audits of all third-party service integrations and their corresponding DNS TXT records to ensure they are active, necessary, and securely configured, mitigating potential subdomain takeover risks.
