# Security Report: rkmvmfamily.in

**Risk:** HIGH

## Summary
The target website, rkmvmfamily.in, exhibits critical security misconfigurations due to the complete absence of essential HTTP security headers. This significantly increases the risk of client-side attacks such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and data exfiltration. The reliance on a shared hosting environment (Plesk) also introduces potential for broader vulnerabilities.

## Findings
- Complete absence of critical HTTP security headers including Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Referrer-Policy.
- The domain utilizes a shared hosting platform (Plesk), which can sometimes lead to shared vulnerabilities or less granular control over server configurations.
- The SPF record uses a '~all' (softfail) mechanism, which is less strict than '-all' (hardfail) and could potentially allow for some email spoofing scenarios.
- Ten subdomains were identified, each representing a potential additional entry point or attack surface that requires further investigation.

## Attack Surface
- Web application (due to missing security headers, potential for XSS, Clickjacking, etc.)
- DNS infrastructure (NS records, potential for misconfiguration)
- Email services (MX record, SPF record, potential for spoofing or enumeration)
- Shared hosting environment (Plesk, potential for common vulnerabilities or misconfigurations)
- Subdomains (each subdomain is a separate attack vector)

## Recommendations
- Immediately implement all missing HTTP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy) with appropriate and robust directives to mitigate various client-side attacks.
- Conduct a thorough review and hardening of the Plesk hosting environment, ensuring all security best practices are applied and applications are adequately isolated.
- Consider updating the SPF record from '~all' to '-all' to enforce a stricter policy against email spoofing, provided all legitimate sending sources are accurately listed.
- Perform a detailed enumeration and vulnerability assessment on all identified subdomains to uncover potential weaknesses and misconfigurations.
